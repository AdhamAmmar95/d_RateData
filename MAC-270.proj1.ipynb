    "The dataset that we chose is about the leading causes of death by sex and race/ethnicity in New York city from 2007 to 2014. We got our dataset from NYC Open Data website[dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/New-York-City-Leading-Causes-of-Death/jb7j-dtam) and the dataset was mainly provided by the Bureau of Vital Statistics and New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Cause of death reported in the dataset is obtained from the NYC death certificate which is issued for every death that happens in New York City. The dataset consists of 1,097 rows and 7 columns. The arrangement of the dataset is mainly based on listing the top 10 leading causes of death by each category, for example, the first 10 rows contain the top 10 leading causes of death for the category of Hispanic males, then the next 10 rows contain the top 10 leading causes of death for Asian and Pacific Islander males, and so on. The causes of death listed in the dataset varies widely from causes related to a disease such as diabetes and HIV to causes not related to diseases such as homicide and accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    " There are two death rate columns in the dataset, one is named death rate, while the other is named age-adjusted death rate, both are expressed as a rate per 100,000 population, the difference is that the death rate column(crude rate) does not take into consideration the age distribution of the population, whereas the age-adjusted death rate does take into consideration the population's age distribution which makes it a more effective way for comparing death rates between different population groups. Our analysis plans include measuring the change in the death rates from 2007 to 2014 among different population groups, comparing death rates among different population groups, finding the most common leading cause of death among all population groups. we will work on producing a clear, meaningful and accurate representation of the data in the form of a bar or a histogram using python's matplotlib library. \n",
